App presents demo dashboard for analysing user's dataset. 

Preview available via https://mdubel.shinyapps.io/wines/

By default there is a `wines` file uploaded with the chemical analysis of different wines.

To use your own dataset upload text file with `;` as a column separator into `/data` folder.

In order to reproduce the code use `packrat::unbundle()` to restore the project dependencies.
